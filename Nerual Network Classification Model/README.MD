## Summary
The goal of this project was the following:
* **Predict** if a student will get into a given school based off the input variables

## Approach
* Create **Neural Network** model in R to predict the problem statement using [neuralnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neuralnet/neuralnet.pdf) package

## Results
* **[RPubs RMarkdown Document](https://rpubs.com/santic_113/562899)**  - RMarkdown document guiding users on my exploratory analysis and what the plots represent and walking through the modeling
