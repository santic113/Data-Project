# Data-Project

Workspace where I will post some of the personal data science projects I work on.

In the "Forecasting Fortune 500 company stock.R" file you will find how to get the data
for the stock. The actual forecast is NOT done here in this space. If you have Rstudio
downloaded everything should run smoothly.
