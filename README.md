# Data-Project

Workspace where I will post some of the personal data science projects I work on.

**Forecasting Fortune 500 company stock.R** file you will find how to get the data for the stock. Meaning, the packages used in that file is how we retrieved all the fortune 500 companies historical stock prices.

**Prophet Forecasting Fortune 500 Company Stock.R** file you will find the prophet forecasting script that actually creates your forecast. Here we account for holidays and build out the model for all the stock using a for loop.

**Tools used** - R, Google BigQuery, SQL, and Atom as my text editor.

**Tableau visualizations** of the forecasted stock prices can be found on Tableau public using this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/santiago.canon#!/vizhome/ForecastallFortune500CompayStock60DaysOut/ForecastingStockDashboard

**Neural Network Classification.R** - Is a classification model that attempts to predict weather a university is a public or private university based off the 18 inputs we provide the model. I used the ISLR library to retrieve data on the universities used in the model.

 If you have Rstudio downloaded everything should run smoothly.
